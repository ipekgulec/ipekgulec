. What is Data Compression?
Data compression means making files smaller so they take up less space and are faster to send or download.
There are two types:
Lossless compression = No data is lost. You can get back the exact original file.
Lossy compression = Some small parts are removed (you can’t get back the exact original), but the file becomes much smaller. Usually used for photos, videos, and music.

Why do we compress data?
To save space on your device.
To upload/download files faster online.
To share files more easily with others (smaller file = easier to send).
To help apps or websites load faster (compressed images, videos).

How is different data compressed?
 A. Text (like .txt, .docx, .pdf)
Uses lossless compression.
Looks for repeated words or letters.
Makes patterns shorter (e.g. "aaaaaa" → "6a").
Common compressed formats:
.zip
.pdf
.docx (it's a zip file inside!)

Images / Photos
Can be lossless or lossy.
Tries to remove small details or colors you can’t see well.
Formats:
Lossless: PNG, GIF
Lossy: JPEG, WebP, HEIC

Music / Audio
Usually lossy, because small sounds can be removed.
Your ears often can’t hear tiny differences.
Popular formats:
MP3
AAC
OGG
FLAC (lossless)

Videos
Mix of images + audio + motion.
Almost always lossy.
Uses frame prediction (saves only the changes between frames).
File formats:
MP4
MOV
AVI
WebM
